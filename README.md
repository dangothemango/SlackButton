# SlackButton
Configure an amazon IoT button to send messages to a slack channel

Uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for data storage and communication with the button

Allows for complete customization of all aspects of the message, including three unique messages depending on the type of button press (Single, Double, Long)
